# Alternative Checkboxes Reference Set

# üéØ Objective

This is an initiative to help standardize the Alternative Checkboxes feature commonly used by the community in Obsidian.md. We are trying to achieve this by analyzing all publicly available implementations of Alternative Checkboxes within Obsidian be it as a Theme, CSS Snippet or Plugin. We are also looking to see if there are any other tools and external standards which could help with our decisions.

# üó£Ô∏è Discussion

Currently, all discussion regarding this is carried out in a thread within the Official Obsidian Discord. For more information please head over there:

# üóÉÔ∏è Usage

This repository serves as a central place for all the files relevant to the discussion. It's intended to be used directly as an Obsidian Vault. All themes and snippets that include Alternative Checkboxes are pre-installed for ease of testing. The following Community plugins are also included:
- `Style Settings` - Required for some themes.
- `Code Editor Shortcuts` - Easier multiline editing.

Please refer to the License section below for more information about what license each Theme / CSS Snippet / Plugin are distributed under.

Ideally, each Alternative Checkbox implementation should be previewed with **only** the relevant Theme / CSS Snippet enabled to avoid styling issues. Remember to only use one CSS Snippet at a time when testing and to have none enabled when testing Theme implementations (unless required). For CSS Snippets, I'd advise to test those with the Default theme enabled unless stated otherwise.

For convenience, I've pinned `Change theme` in the Command Palette for a quicker way to change themes.

# üõ† Contributing

At the moment, there are no direct guidelines for contributing to this repository. Ideally, any contributions should be mentioned in the Discussion thread first.
