# Alternative Checkboxes Reference Set
An initiative to standardize the Alternative Checkboxes feature commonly used by the community in Obsidian.md

Currently all discussion regarding this is carried out in a thread within the Official Obsidian Discord. For more information please head over there:

This repository serves as a central place for all the files relevant to the discussion. It's intended to be used directly as an Obsidian Vault. All themes and snippets that include Alternative Checkboxes are pre-installed for ease of testing. Please respect all licenses involved with the included Themes / CSS Snippets. If you are an author of any of them and would like me to remove them from this repo, create an issue.

Ideally, each Alternative Checkbox implementation should be previewed with the relevant Theme / CSS Snippet enabled. Remember to only use one CSS Snippet at the time when testing and to have none enable when testing Theme implementations (unless required) to avoid issues. For CSS Snippets, I'd advise to test those with the Default theme enabled unless stated otherwise.

The only included Community plugins are:
- `Style Settings` - Required for some themes.
- `Code Editor Shortcuts` - Easier multiline editing.

For convenience, I've pinned `Change theme` in the Command Pallete for a quicker way to change themes.

At the moment, there are no guidelines to directly contributing to this repository.
